<!-- Release 0: Make a Plan -->
I plan on doing some research on how to make jQuery the most useful for me in general and what I want to do specifically. 

Googling specific actions I would want jQuery to do and to also see examples of what I want to implement.

I think it's important to stop and try something you just learned as often as possible, so that you know if it works or not sooner than later.

Breaks are important if you are stuck or struggling with something. Breaks are even good if you are on a roll, just to give your brain a quick break can do wonders.

<!-- Release 1: Study Up -->
The strategies that were most effective was looking up documentation and seeing examples of jQuery in action.
