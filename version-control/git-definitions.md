# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Version control is useful because you can always look back at previous versions for reference if needed.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? 
	A branch is an independent line of development. You would use a branch when working on new features or bug fixes.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A git commit records changes to the repository. A good commit message is informative and understandable. The reader should not be confused on what changes were made. 
* What is a merge conflict?
	A merge conflict is when your branch and the branch you want to merge into the current branch have diverged.
